#+TITLE:My Personal Emacs Config
[[./img/configScreenCap.png]]
* Installation
Move the init.el file to your ~/.emacs.d/ directory (if there is none, just create it, after having installed emacs of course), open emacs, wait for it to download the packages, and done!
* To-dos [10/10]
- [X] integrate, some more prefixes
- [X] consider which key
- [X] check out sublimity, if not find an alternative to minimap or maybe not
- [X] install ivy and integrate it with current config
- [X] decrease delay time of displaying keystrokes in the minibuffer, see magnars' config to see if he has the name of the variable to change
- [X] find out a better way to source config file without restarting emacs
- [X] bind a key to open your config file without having to constantly search through your home directory just to open it
- [X] test the necessity of general.el see if same setup can be duplicated without the use of the package and if it's reliable (speed wise)
- [X] (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "ESC") (kbd "C-g")) works well, but in gui only (not really an issue but can be confusing in terminal), possible consideration, figure out where to put it in config
- [X] (define-key query-replace-map [escape] 'quit) <-- use this to get escape to work in the save file dialog, this and the one above call different functions
